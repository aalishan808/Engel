CREATE next js project,
setup the firebase by installing firebase cli creating firebase project, 
adding firebase config set the local environment variables with the secrets 
we have set up the firebase now with our nextjs project
create github repository with name engel for now i made public repo but best practice is to make it private and add contributors to it 
Add that remote repo to my local file so that i will be able to push and pull code there
Right now i am working solo in this project so i will be working in the main branch
